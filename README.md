## Background

This project involves creating an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. The dataset catalogs the microbes found in human navels. Interestingly, the study found that a small number of microbial species (also known as operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) were present in over 70% of individuals, while the majority of species were relatively rare.

## Objective

The primary objective of this assignment is to build a user-friendly and interactive dashboard that allows users to delve into the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. The dashboard will enable users to visualize and analyze the microbial diversity within human navels and understand the prevalence of different OTUs among individuals.
